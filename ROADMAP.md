<h1>roadmap</h1>

<h2>what are my further plans for this website?</h2>

* metadata editor for galleries and friendbook
* add friend graph tool to display who knows each other and how
* open-source useful features separately (gotta make simplified example code first)
    * PhotoSwipe extensions for video and embeds (with cookie disclaimer)
    * friendbook
* add "tag friends" functionality to photo gallery
    * idea: on-hover overlay around the face which looks like a labelled polaroid
* rewrite all helper tools in JavaScript, makes more sense in a web context and most web devs have [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/node) on their systems anyway
* maybe implement social features as described on the "vision for society" section on my website, might as well put those ideas into separate projects (would open-source anything useful separately anyway)
