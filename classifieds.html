                <a href="society.html">personally, I don't believe in money as being the be-all and end-all anyway</a>, if you have some cool stuff or good weed you wanna trade for something on this page I'm perfectly fine with that as well ‚úåÔ∏è

                    (<span class="classifieds-price">‚Ç¨50 ONO</span>, <span class="classifieds-new-price">new price approx. ‚Ç¨130 on AliExpress (comparable model)</span>)

                        <li>found it on my street, guess some Chinese student left it there after their year abroad has ended or sth like that, it looked functional so I took it with me and cleaned it</li>
                        <li>works like a charm, but the pot's anti-stick coating is a bit scuffed but they do replacement pots for ‚Ç¨30 on AliExpress and you can always just use aluminium foil</li>
                        <li>it's a shame I'm selling this rice cooker, it's a smart model with different settings for various rice dishes and a start timer but I just don't need a rice cooker that big for a single household</li>
                        <li>maybe I'll keep it if <a href="society.html">my idea of turning my flat into a hangout space</a> takes off, if I have a lot of people over it'd be perfect, in that case I'd remove this ad</li>
