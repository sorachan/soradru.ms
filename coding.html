                <li>if you need a freelance developer for a software project, hit me up!</li>
                <li>
                    my main focus so far has been small console / graphical tools and web development (frontend and backend), not too experienced with apps but sure I could wrap my head around app development as well
                    <ul>
                        <li>I'm not a <em>web designer</em> though, I'm not the person you're looking for if you want a beautiful CSS layout, my CSS skills reach about far enough to create a personal webpage intended to look like a modern responsive version of a 2007 emo blog</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    I have no problem tackling tasks that are new to me such as working with a new language or framework. 70% of programming boils down to understanding basic language-independent concepts and consulting StackOverflow / documentation anyway (never forget to RTFM!)
                </li>
                <li>I write clean and commented code and have experience with Scrum development</li>
                <li>my programing style is pragmatic, not dogmatic. concepts like OOP design patterns or "writing Pythonic code" are useful tools to have at one's disposal, but not must-use cornerstones of good code. I tend to minimise dependencies on external packages, but do so when it's necessary so as not to reinvent the wheel. also, optimisation is nice to have but it quickly turns into over-engineering.</li>

                    language skills:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Python (advanced)</li>
                        <li>Java (advanced)</li>

                        <li>x86 Assembler (basic)</li>

                <li>
                    I built this website from scratch without any templates / boilerplates
                    <ul>
                        <li>but I decided to include <a href="https://photoswipe.com/">PhotoSwipe</a> as a vanilla JS gallery solution and wrote code to facilitate gallery creation</li>
                        <li>I extended PhotoSwipe, which normally only allows images, to support videos as well as YouTube and Vimeo embeds</li>
                        <li>I wrote a Python script which traverses an image folder, reads the camera make / model and date / time from the EXIF metadata and automatically generates thumbnails and the gallery descriptor files, as well as a Bash script to help me caption and credit pictures, and extended PhotoSwipe to display credit, camera and date info</li>
                        <li>the <a href="https://github.com/sorachan/soradru.ms">source code for this website</a> is on my GitHub</li>
                    </ul>

                </li>
                <li>check out <a href="http://mines.dillbox.me">my Minesweeper clone</a>, so conservatively written it works on anything from IE6 to Chrome Mobile (tap the smiley for instructions), won a small coding competition with that (sorry, this piece of code is uncommented, wrote it in a hurry, however it's very basic so you should be able to figure it out. if you still have any questions, just ask me, I like explaining stuff xD)</li>
                <li>check out my GitHub (link in the footer) to see some of my past projects</li>
                <li>might seem weird to have a drummer coding your stuff but then again, Dream Theater's drummer Mike Mangini used to write code for NASA so why not</li>
