                <li>if you need a freelance developer for a software project, hit me up!</li>
                <li>my main focus so far has been small console / graphical tools and web development (frontend and backend), not too experienced with apps but sure I could wrap my head around app development as well</li>
                <li>I write clean and commented code and have experience with Scrum development</li>
                <li>
                    language skills:

                </li>
                <li>I built this website from scratch without any templates / boilerplates</li>
                <li>check out <a href="http://mines.dillbox.me">my Minesweeper clone</a>, so conservatively written it works on anything from IE6 to Chrome Mobile (tap the smiley for instructions), won a small coding competition with that (sorry, this piece of code is uncommented, wrote it in a hurry)</li>
                <li>check out my GitHub (link in the footer) to see some of my past projects</li>
                <li>might seem weird to have a drummer coding your stuff but then again, Dream Theater's drummer Mike Mangini used to write code for NASA so why not</li>
