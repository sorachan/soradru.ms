                <li>currently playing with <a href="https://instagram.com/iltismusic">Iltis</a>, but always looking for projects as far as my schedule permits them</li>
                <li>if you wanna collab on a track or want me to play a gig, hit me up!</li>
                <li>
                    ready to explore the open road and play some music, somebody's gotta just pick me up! 🧳
                    <li>
                        that is, as far as my schedule permits. until mid-2024-ish I'm gonna work towards (finally) finishing my bachelor's degrees (yes, plural) and the current Iltis roadmap item #1 is writing and recording some music by the end of the year, wouldn't leave those guys hanging. 💖

                            <li>I can do all of my work on my laptop while on a tour bus or in a hotel, I'm not easily distracted and I write reliable code even when baked 😂</li>
