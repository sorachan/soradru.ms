            <p>
                ⚠️ <em>warning:</em> this list is gonna be very long. 😅
            </p>
            <p>
                my friends are like family to me, I don't really differentiate, that's why my family members are listed here as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've even included some loose acquaintances and members from favourite bands in this list if I have some nice things to say about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                if we were friends at any point in time and you do not find yourself listed here, it's not because I forgot about you, it's just because I have a chaotic mind and managing a website with that much content single-handedly is a major pain in the arse.
            </p>
            <p>
                if we've lost touch with over the years, it was often for stupid reasons or because of <a href="mental.html">my mental health issues <em>(trigger warning)</em></a>… I never meant to ghost you, I just fell into a deep hole and didn't have it in me to keep in touch with you, it was not because you're not special to me.
            </p>
            <p>
                maybe I even forgot your name because I am such a forgetful person but I still remember the times we've shared, you'll probably find yourself listed in the "anonymous" section then.
            </p>
