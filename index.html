                Hi there! Welcome to my web page! I'm Sora – musician, tech nerd, awkward emo. Check out the navigation bar above to get around the website. It's still a work in progress, so expect some placeholders, empty pages and broken plugins. If you're visiting from a mobile device, please bear with me – this website was only created on 3.28 and I don't have any team behind me. Just didn't get around to coding mobile CSS yet, but I'll definitely do it in the next few days.
            </p>
