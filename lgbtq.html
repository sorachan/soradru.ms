            <h2>gender identity 🏳️‍⚧️</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm non-binary / genderfluid and I don't really care about pronouns, just about anything is fine with me. (not a big fan of "it" though)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>sexuality 🏳️‍🌈</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I'm pansexual which means I can imagine relationships with people of any gender</li>
                <li>do definitely plan to start a family later in lafe though</li>
                <li>in 2010 by the time I started going to emo meetups, I had some experience with girls but had never kissed a guy before</li>
                <li>
                    however, we all tended to get drunk and make out with other and before I knew it I had some guy's tongue in my neck and what can I say other than… "I kissed a boy and I liked it?" (sorry, not sorry)
                    <ul>
                        that reminds me… I still owe <a href="friends.html#valea">Valea</a> a sexy dance to the tune of "I kissed a girl"… don't think she still wants it but I'm still good on that promise xD
                    </ul>
