                <p>
                    I'd love nothing more than to make a living playing music.
                </p>
                <p>
                    if that doesn't work out, being a software dev or maths teacher doesn't sound too bad either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    but tbh I don't want to spend the rest of my life in employment.
                </p>
                <p>
                    if music doesn't work out, I'll try to build some other business on my own, my goal is to be my own boss one day.
                </p>
                <p>
                    "but you're such a smart guy, wouldn't becoming a rock drummer be a waste?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    nope. playing music doesn't mean my education goes out the window and who says I can't drum and still develop software or tutor on the side? Mike Mangini from Dream Theater used to code for NASA, some other people in bands pursued PHDs, started their own labels or did other cool shit, so why the heck not? I'm not confined to the ideal of kissing asses to work towards a cushy executive position or some shit like that, it's just not my vibe

                            <ul>
                                <li>I've seen some older videos on YouTube where bands like Silverstein and Avenged Sevenfold would let fans play an instrument for one song.

                <summary>what's the story behind the licence plate on your wall?</summary>
                <p>
                    in 2016 I went abroad for a year in Durham, UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    during my time there I bought a lot of shit including a digital piano, a drum kit and a bike.
                </p>
                <p>
                    when my year abroad came to an end, I was faced with the question of how to get everything home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I crunched some numbers and figured that it would be cheaper to buy a run-down van and drive back to Germany than to ship everything and take the train or plane.
                </p>
                <p>
                    so I borrowed 500 quid from my mum (thank you so much for your financial support, I wouldn't know what I'd do without!) and took the train to Guiseley (near Leeds) and bought a used Citroen Berlingo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    after driving around a bit in a residential area to get used to sitting on the right-hand side of a vehicle, I drove the 80 miles home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the car didn't have a stereo, so I blasted Saosin's In Search of Solid Ground on my mini JBL speaker.
                </p>
                <p>
                    bought a car radio on Gumtree a couple of days later.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the seller was a bit shady, apparaently he had just bought the car a couple of days earlier and didn't have the new V5C yet and gave me an already used vehicle ownership transfer slip from the old owner's V5C. also, he asked me to remove the signage of his electrical company that was still on the van.
                </p>
                <p>
                    figured this out after doing a bit of research and finding the ad from the old owner on Gumtree with whom I've had a phone call and who was also shocked by the backhanded behaviour of the seller.
                </p>
                <p>
                    long story short, drove the van back to Germany and a couple of days later it died on the Autobahn.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the cooling fluid was leaking and I forgot to fill it up so I wrecked the engine.
                </p>
                <p>
                    phoned up a couple of scrapyards and found one that would still give me 50 euros for the van so I asked my best pal to tow me to the scrapyard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    on the way there, when making a left turn, my pal cut someone off who drove onto the towing rope so I was pulled right into his driver side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    my mum towed me to the scrapyard a couple of days later, kept the car radio and the licence plates.

                    left-wing, I also like the idea of communism and think the examples of failed communist states are due greed of those in power, not due to a problem with communism itself.

                <p>
                    I have a NYT subscription and also like reading the Guardian and watching "Tagesschau" on german public broadcasting, but I do have weeks or months where I'm just too caught up in my own world to keep track of what's happening on the outside.
                </p>
                <p>
                    also a big fan of political late-night comedy. love John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Fallon, Jimmy Kimmel, Trevor Noah and all the other late-night greats!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also watch German political late-night shows like extra3 and heute-show sometimes, but the jokes are rather boring tbh.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the most entertaining personality on German late-night TV has to be Jan B√∂hmermann.

                <p>
                    fuck Putin and fuck the war in Ukraine is what my thoughts on this topic are.
                </p>
                <p>
                    the Ukrainian people have every right to defend themselves and refugees are welcome in Germany and elsewhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like Russia as a country when it comes to the culture and travelling there is definitely on my bucket list but I despise Russian politics.
                </p>
                <p>
                    keep in mind that many Russians don't agree with Putin. all the Russians I've met in my life have been genuinely nice and open-minded people and I'm not gonna let some lunatic's dreams of an empire taint my love for the rich cultural heritage and beautiful language that Russia has to offer.
                </p>

                    also had one month of guitar lessons a while ago from a voucher my mum bought on Groupon.

                    quit taking lessons because I couldn't afford them anymore, might take some more later.

                <p>
                    used to be a diehard Linux fanboy (ditched Windows in 2016.)
                </p>
                <p>
                    but I have to say, since 2023.2 I have been using macOS more extensively and I have to say I don't miss Linux that much, macOS is a really nice, polished and well-usable operating system with a lot of nice built-in features and multi-touch trackpad gestures that make up for the fact that I only have one screen to work with.
                </p>
                <p>
                    for professional music applications, Linux is a catastrophe compared to macOS, they simply provide the best basis for audio applications with their Core Audio subsystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    would still advocate for Linux, though, it's a great and stable system and it's taken quantum leaps in usability since I started using it at age 8 in 2003. (my first distro was SuSE 8.2)
                </p>
                <p>
                    also, the server hosting this website is running on Linux. I'm the admin of my own web and mail server.

                    it's a simple one from graph theory.

                <p>
                    I'm gonna word it in more understandable terms than graph theory lingo.

                    statement: at any party, there must be at least two people who have greeted the same number of people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    proof by contradiction:
                    <ul>
                        <li>let's assume the opposite: that everyone at the party has greeted a different number of people.</li>
                        <li>there are N people at the party.</li>
                        <li>the number of people greeted can lie in the range from 0 to N‚Äì1.</li>
                        <li>that's N choices for N people.</li>
                        <li>by the pigeonhole principle, that means for any of those numbers, there would be one person who has greeted that number of people.</li>
                        <li>but that would mean there's one person who has greeted nobody (0) and one person who has greeted everyone else (N‚Äì1) which is a logical contradiction.</li>
                        <li>assuming falseness of the statement yields a contradiction, hence the statement must be true.</li>
                    </ul>
