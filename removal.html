<p>
    if you're one of them, please contact me via call / SMS / WhatsApp / Telegram / Signal / any of my socials (footer), my phone number is still the same as always.
</p>
<p>
    you can just tell me what you want removed from my page, but tbh I'd love nothing more than to put all past bullshit aside and to hear some about what's been going on in your lives and reminisce about old times a bit, maybe even start hanging out again.
</p>
<p>
    I know I've been a major idiot in my past who has hurt many people's feelings needlessly but believe me, no matter how hackneyed and clichéd this sounds, I have learned from my past mistakes and I own up to them.
</p>
<p>
    I guess you could say I've finally "grown up" even though I'll always be an awkward emo teen at heart.
</p>
<p>
    I'm trying my best to be as candid and honest about what's going on in my life and the times I've fucked up as I can without airing other people's dirty laundry.
</p>
<p>
    if there's any instance of me being an arsehole that you want included on this page for sake of completeness, tell me and I will add it.
</p>
<p>
    I believe in second chances, do you? 💖
</p>
<p>
    that of course also applies if you don't want your socials linked or your employer to know what you did as a teen or on a party night.
</p>
<p>
    I promise to purge everything from both the website and the GitHub repository and try my best to keep web crawlers out of the friends and photos section of this website, can't take responsibility for people saving stuff locally though.
</p>
<p>
    if you wanna expand or change your profile info, please hmu on my phone or socials and tell me what you want included and how you want it styled.
</p>
<p>
    I can make you a personal business card or flyer out of a subset of your profile for free (just buy me a pack of coffee capsules or think of a personal way to say thanks 😇) if you want me to, business cards are a wonderful medium to quickly visually communicate who you are and what you do and it's a shame that they've gone out of style 🌁
</p>
<p>
    the friendbook JSON template can be found <a href="friends/template.json">here</a>, fill out as much as you like and remove the properties you haven't used.
</p>
<p>
    if you want any custom properties or content included, tell me and we can make it work.
</p>
<p>
    also, I miss the times when everyone had a MySpace and was applying their own unique CSS style to it, that's why I've decided to give you the opportunity to style your own profile to match your wonderful unique personality 🦄
</p>
<p>
    the template can be found here (TO DO!) <a href="friends/template.css">here</a>, my recommendation would be to visit your friendbook profile in a browser, right-click on your profile, click "inspect", select the <code>&lt;div class="friendbook-profile" data-friend-id="john.doe"&gt;</code> element and tinker around with some custom CSS until you like what you see after which you can write your code into a file and send it to me. 
</p>
<p class="caution">
    refreshing the web page will destroy all your hard work, my recommendation is to create a local CSS file and to copy the content into the inspector stylesheet after load.
</p>
<p>
    if you don't know CSS and don't want to learn it (I encourage you, it's pretty cool and it's not too hard, I can teach you) just tell me your design wishes in an e-mail or text and I will create the CSS styling for you 
</p>
<p>
    peace, love and hugs to every single one of you! ☮️💖🤗🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
