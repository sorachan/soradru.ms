            <h2>my vision for society</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I believe in a society where we help each other with our skills for free or as much or little as people can give.
                </li>
                <li>
                    money is a useful invention as bartering often is not an option and having a universally accepted token for value exchange makes perfect sense, but financial wealth is not the be-all and end-all and should never be a prerequisite for living a happy and independent life.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I want to try my best to act as a catalyst for such communities to form and grow.
                </li>
                <li>
                    some of my inspirations for such community work include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            the DIY ethos of the hardcore punk scene
                            <ul>
                                <li>many of the shows in the scene are self-organised by a tight-knit community of people who know and help each other fulfil their dream of playing music.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    you don't need a stage to play a show, all you need is people to provide you with a space.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            some of my favourite YouTube clips to illustrate this are a video of <a data-music-url="https://open.spotify.com/artist/3eGwai0HULCeraystshybw">I Would Set Myself on Fire for You</a> playing in someone's basement without microphones and three videos of <a data-music-url="https://open.spotify.com/artist/4ZIBrskTJWmkJUvM7uAu1o">Chiodos</a> performing songs in some dude's basement after their show for the evening got cancelled. as Chiodos would put it, "this is love." üíñüé∂üßë‚Äçüé§ also, this is pretty ironic as they have a song called "<a data-music-url="https://open.spotify.com/track/1Z2CB3dT4Zgs4wO9SQNvvW">No Hardcore Dancing in the Living Room</a>" lol

                                            also fondly remember some gigs with <a href="https://facebook.com/WEAREGECKO/">Gecko</a> at Empty Shop which was a venue in a converted apartment in an old building, it was poorly isolated and the people outside could definitely hear us playing. the scene in Durham was just so much more connected.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>

                        </li>
                        <li>
                            the hippies
                            <ul>
                                <li>that doesn't mean we all have to live in communes, go eco-friendly and hang out smoking weed but they definitely got the community aspect of life right.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>

                            "do you care to be a layer of the bricks that seal your fate or would you rather be the architect of what we might create?"

                    some wanna-do coding projects include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>foodsharing app where neighbours can communicate which groceries they can give away for free / little</li>
                        <li>(neighbourhood) networking app where people can list skills with which they can help each other out</li>

                    haven't put any research yet into whether such platforms already exist and how well they do and how user-friendly they are. if they already exist, please tell me, there's no need to reinvent the <s>wheel</s> drum [ba-dum-tss ü•Å] (might still code them just for fun, I don't really care if someone's done it before)
