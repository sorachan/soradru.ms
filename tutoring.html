            <ul>
                <li>I used to tutor maths and CompSci at uni for 6 years and did private maths tutoring (school level) for a couple of years as well</li>
                <li>if you need any help with maths (school level to basic university level [analysis, linear algebra, discrete mathematics], typesetting with LaTeX) or CompSci (programming 101 [Java, JavaScript, Python, Sage, C, C++]) in English or German, hit me up! I have a chill and calm approach to teaching and my classes have always been popular with students. remote or in person, rates can be discussed in private.</li>
